1. In the grid layouting system, justify-item and justify-self properties are used to align the child items 
individually inside a grid container horizontally.

2. The property justify-item is given at parent/container level inside a grid and it by-default defines the 
justify-self property for all the items or childs inside the grid container.That means, whenever we want to 
align all the child items in a grid container in a similar manner in horizontal direction , we prefer to use the 
justify-item property just once at parent grid level for all of them. 

Example: .container{
              display: grid;
              justify-items: center; // aligns all the childs inside container horizontally at center. 
                 }

3. On the other hand, justify-self property is used or set at the child or item level inside the grid container,
and it individually set the property of only that item for which it is defined. So, whenever a usecase arises 
when we want to align a particular child of a grid container in a certain manner then inside that child in css
we define the particular alignment property by using justify-self and not at the parent level.

Example:   .parent{
               display: grid;
                 } 
           .child1{
               justify-self: center; // aligns only child1 inside parent horizontally at center.
               }
